# DiscordRemote
This bot allows you to enter some commands in the terminal of the computer hosting the program through discord commands. Some commands may not work and may cause unexpected results which may even stop the bot like for example, text editors like VIM, which will keep the command prompt locked into their program preventing further entries from the Discord Bot.

Remember to put your bot token in the variable `TOKEN`
